library(plotly)
data("presidents")
ts <- window(presidents, start=c(1960, 1), end=c(1974, 4))
```

## Presidential Approval Rating, 1960-1974

```{r plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
plot_ly(x = ~time(ts), y = ~ts, type = "scatter", mode = "lines") %>%
        layout(xaxis = list(title = "Year"), yaxis = list(title = "Percent Approval"))

### knit and then use the publish button to send to Rpubs
### vs push to github pages
```
